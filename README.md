# WellBeingAnalysis
Well-being Analysis is a thesis, which consists in creating well-being indexes through sentiment analysis of user reviews.

It can be separated in two different main procedures, that later will be merged to produce a system able to create multidimensional well-being indexes.
Those procedures are:
- Design of a sentiment analysis system
- Design of a multidimensional database capable of storing the multidimensional well-being indexes created through the process of sentiment analysis
